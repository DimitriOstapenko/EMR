Covid-19 is here and it’s not a regular flu. This virus is much more contagious and much more deadly, especially for older people with health conditions.  There’s no cure and no vaccine at this point. So please treat the situation seriously and take all measures to keep yourself safe.
If you have any or all of these symptoms: fever, coughing, weakness, sweating, muscle pain, do not go to see a doctor, this is a sure way to spread the infection!  Please stay at home and call a doctor. You can register and make a telemedicine appointment with dr. Ostapenko using the button above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mask or no mask?</b> Surgical masks in general, but especially N95 (US) or FFP3 (Europe) help to prevent the spread of the disease. If you have Covid-19 symptoms, it’s recommended to wear a mask in public.
