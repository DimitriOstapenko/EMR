	<h3>User Categories</h3>
</a>

<p>
EMR supports 3 user levels: 
<dt class="col-sm-1">Staff User </dt><dd class="col-sm-11">Reserved to clinic staff, this user class has most privileges as far as creating, viewing and editing data, but cannot perform destructive actions and administrative functions. </dd></dt>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dt class="col-sm-1">Doctor</dt><dd class="col-sm-11">Doctors have access only to pages relevant to them. They cannot view patient registry, perform admin functions or view other doctors' pages. Some of the functions are limited to viewing only. This includes billing functions, list of medications, diagnoses and service codes, insurance providers etc. Still, doctors have full functionality as far as daysheet during their work hours and can assign diagnoses and service codes to visits during those hours. They also have access to most documents and reference pages relevant to their patients including patient chart. They can generate their own billing reports, create letters, referrals and other documents relating to their patients.</dd>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dt class="col-sm-1">Admin</dt><dd class="col-sm-11"> Users of this class have full system privileges and can perform destructive functions not accessible to ather user classes including deleting visits and patient records with all related information.</dd>

  <div class="panel-body">
User class is assigned by administrator during user setup which works as follows: administrator creates user by registering name and email and assigning user class. After this information is saved into database, confirmation email is sent automatically to the newly registered user. This email contains activation link. By clicking this link the user is taken to their profile page, where they can assign new password only known to them. After this step new user can log into system remotely from any desktop or mobile device and have access to all pages of their user class. Forgotten password is emaild to user's registered email on request.  

This Help File describes functionality of Walk-In EMR at the staff user level. There is similar description for administrative and doctor pages
